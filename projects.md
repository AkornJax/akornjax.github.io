    <h2>Beleaguered Woods</h2>
    <p>I'm a passionate game developer and artist that strives to create something new and unique for the world to see.
      I push my game design skills by insuring that every decision is solidified by player testing and sufficient
      research. When I'm not coding or planning on paper how to manage the flow of data for my project, I immerse myself
      in the artistic passion of others whilst making sure I stretch my own art-muscles on a daily basis. </p>

    <p>I am currently a student at TAMU University with an expected graduation in Fall 2020 (if everything goes well)
      and planning on continuing onto the Visualization Grad Program at TAMU.</p>
