My contribution to the BeleaguredWoods:
    <ul>
        <li>
        I coded and designed all aspects of the overworld to guide the player to their next encounter but allow for exploration. 
        </li>
        <li>
        I designed all the pixel art animations designed to complement the gameplay and tell a story. (Goto)
        </li>
        <li>
        I designed and implemented the dialogue system to drive visual storytelling. 
        </li>
        <li>
        I implemented the sound to enhance player feedback.
        </li> ​
        I made drastic, tactful cuts to the scope to ensure that we had a full experience by the deadline.
        </li>
        <li>
        Contributed to character and battle design.
