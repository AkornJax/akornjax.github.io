### My Goals

I'm a passionate game developer and artist that strives to create something new and unique for the world to see. I push my game design skills by insuring that every decision is solidified by player testing and sufficient research. When I'm not coding or planning on paper how to manage the flow of data for my project, I immerse myself in the artistic passion of others whilst making sure I stretch my own art-muscles on a daily basis.
