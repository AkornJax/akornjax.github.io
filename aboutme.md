          <h2>My Goals</h2>
          <br>
          <p>I'm a developer that's obsessed with learning every step of the pipeline. By age 35 I hope to be able to develop AAA quality games as an indie developer.
            I push my game design skills by insuring that every decision is solidified by player testing and sufficient
            research. When I'm not coding or planning on paper how to manage the flow of data for my project, I immerse myself
            in the artistic passion of others whilst making sure I stretch my own art-muscles on a daily basis. </p>
