It started with this goofiness, where I was struggling to get anything proper to render.

Eventually I got spheres and planes to render but shading was still a work-in-progress...

Lighting and shadows! The shadowded area looks weird because I got tired of staring into the the void, so the shadow is instead the complimentary color of the diffuse value, but darkened a little bit. Still a work in progress, but I'm trying to make the shader more stylized by being informed by artistic principles.

Attempt at a realtime area light!... Definitely needs some work. It's currently randomly sampling but immediately overwriting those samples, not sure how to keep them persisting.

Spotlight: Soon! I just need more time. 

Texture mapping of spheres and planes!
