It started with this goofiness, where I was struggling to get anything proper to render.

Eventually I got spheres and planes to render but shading was still a work-in-progress...

Lighting and shadows! The shadowded area looks weird because I got tired of staring into the the void, so the shadow is instead the complimentary color of the diffuse value, but darkened a little bit. Still a work in progress, but I'm trying to make the shader more stylized by being informed by artistic principles.

Attempt at a realtime area light!... Definitely needs some work. It's currently randomly sampling but immediately overwriting those samples, not sure how to keep them persisting.

Spotlight: Soon! I just need more time. 

Texture mapping of spheres and planes!

	• Specular highlights (sharp and soft)
    • Directional and point spot lights
	• Bonus: Outlines

Changing FOV is simple with your typical camera setup. In my case, it was achieved by moving the pixel plane further from the eye location. This mimics moving the lense further or closer to the sensor. That distance is called the **focal length**.

Specular working correctly. It's simply the dot product of the eye/view direction and the reflected vector (found using the surface normal and light direction). To change the sharpness/smoothness you just take your resulting specular intensity and raise it to a power `n`. As `n` increases the sharpness increases and vice versa. 
Here is `n = 250`:

Here is `n = 10` with the specular coefficient turned down to `Ks = .8f`:

Point light and directional lights have been used throughout all my images, but here are some good captures of them:

Added outlines! Easily calculated by checking the angle of the normal to the eye and then inverting the values:
```
    border_intensity = glm::max(0.0f, 1.0f - glm::abs(glm::dot(normal, eye_direction)));
    border_intensity = glm::step(BORDER_THICKNESS, border_intensity);
```
The real magic comes from using the `step` shaping function, otherwise you're left with a smooth transition. Although if preferred, then you can simply switch to using the `smoothstep` shaping function.
