Progress is slow... Wrapping my head around how to structure my code has been incredibly taxing. My biggest crux has been using C++ to code this, which I am actually not entirely familiar with. Although I've learned a TON of C++, which is useful, it is putting me behind on learning the concepts. I definitely should've coded in C# or python! Oh well...

Here is a tetrahedron! (With a low-res environment map... I should change that.)

The cube normals are borked, I struggled to figure out how the tetrahedron worked fine but the cube didn't. I also drew individual triangles and that worked out great. Further testing is definitely needed, but I need to move on!

This was goofy. I have no idea why my light was causing this "heat vision" effect on my reflections...

The reflections are lookin' good now.

A nice showcase of the reflections.

First taste of refraction/transmission! Close to getting it working great.
