## My contribution to the Luci's Lemonade Stand:

Lead programmer, revised and refactored the code from the other programmers.
Lead designer, designed all aspects of the game and guided the art direction.
Project manager, set up timelines and deadlines using codecks.io and made the call to cut content.

Worked in a team of seven over the duration of 10 weeks.
Design decisions were focused on creating modular systems, emergent gameplay through physics-based interactions, and easily extendable gameplay.
