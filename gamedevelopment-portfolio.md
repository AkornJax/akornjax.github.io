        Second place overall for the LIVE Lab COVID 2020 Game Jam.
        <h1> My contribution to the Panacea:</h1>
        <p>
        I coded and designed all aspects of the overworld to guide the player to their next encounter but allow for exploration. 
        I designed all the pixel art animations designed to complement the gameplay and tell a story. (Goto)
        I designed and implemented the dialogue system to drive visual storytelling. 
        I implemented the sound to enhance player feedback. ​
        I made drastic, tactful cuts to the scope to ensure that we had a full experience by the deadline.
        Contributed to character and battle design.

        Worked with a team of three to make a turn-based RPG in the span of two weeks. 
        The game was conceived to emphasize and bring awareness to the importance of social distancing in combating the spread of COVID-19.

 <h1> My contribution to the Medieval RPS:</h1>
         <p>
            Modeled, textured, rigged, and animated hands to give the player a strong, unique character representation. 
            Conceptualized, rigged, and animated 2D skeleton bosses to add character and movement to the screen.
            Created UE4 shaders for visually showing status effects present on players.
            Engineered and tweaked all gameplay elements based off observations from player testing.​ 

                    Created for the TAMU Game Studio Fall 2019.
            Conceived during a game jam at the beginning of the semester with the prompt of "rock, paper, scissors" and decided to stick with the game idea and push it as far as possible.
            Two-player co-op game where you play rock, paper, scissors against giant skeletons using the mystical power of the jewelry given "accidentally" by the first skeleton.
