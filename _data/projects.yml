      - Conceptualized, rigged, and animated 2D skeleton bosses to add character and movement to the screen.
      - Created UE4 shaders for visually showing status effects present on players.
      - I implemented the sound to enhance player feedback.
      - I made drastic, tactful cuts to the scope to ensure that the project was a full experience by the deadline.

      Created for the TAMU Game Studio Fall 2019. 
      Conceived during a game jam at the beginning of the semester with the prompt of “rock, paper, scissors” and decided to stick with the game idea and push it as far as possible. 
      Two-player co-op game where you play rock, paper, scissors against giant skeletons using the mystical power of the jewelry given “accidentally” by the first skeleton.
    status: Finished, but interested in recreating it.
